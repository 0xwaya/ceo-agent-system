Ohio LLC Legal Compliance & Certification Agent

Ohio-specific legal logic (ORC Title XVII, WBENC/SBA/NMSDC certifications,
minority/woman-owned business compliance) has been absorbed into the
legal_llm_compliance_node system prompt in graph_architecture/llm_nodes.py
and the full legal subgraph in graph_architecture/subgraphs/legal_subgraph.py.

This file is no longer wired into any active graph nodes.
Do NOT add new legal logic here — use the legal_subgraph instead.
