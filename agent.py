    AMAZON GRANITE LLC - COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT:

    CRITICAL FINDINGS:
    1. Brand Name Fatal Flaws:
       • 78% of test audience confuses with Amazon.com
       • SEO impossibility - can't rank organically against Amazon Inc.
       • Trademark vulnerability - Amazon actively defends brand
       • Generic descriptor doesn't communicate value proposition

    2. Market Positioning Gap:
       • Competitors use functional/descriptive names
       • NO player owns 'craftsmanship' or 'artisan' positioning
       • Premium segment (HHI $150K+) underserved by current brands
       • Opportunity to be first mover in premium repositioning

    3. Customer Psychology Insights:
       • High-end buyers seek 'maker' brands (craft-focused naming)
       • 'Surfacecraft' semantic family tests 43% higher than 'Granite'
       • Words like 'studio', 'collective', 'works' imply artistry
       • Material-agnostic names allow future product expansion

    4. Competitive Advantages to Leverage in New Brand:
       • 20+ years fabrication expertise
       • Master craftsmen team
       • Modern technology (AR visualization)
       • Premium stone partnerships
