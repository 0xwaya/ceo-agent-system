After running an agent from `/admin` → `Agents` → `Run & View Output`, you can review saved files in two ways:

- In-app: generated files appear directly in the workspace under **Generated Files**
- On disk: open `static/generated_outputs/<agent_type>/<run_id>_<company_slug>/`

Common generated outputs include `result.json`, `summary.md`, and agent-specific artifacts (for branding this includes SVG logo proposals and social avatars).
